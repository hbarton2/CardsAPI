# CardsAPI
API for a deck of cards

As of now you can create a deck of cards with any combination of suits, names, and colors. For instance, you could simulate a game of five crowns (if you know what that is) as opposed to just a game with a standard deck of playing cards. All you have to do is change the lists at the start of the file.

There is functionality to shuffle, draw from the deck, and deal any amount of cards to any amount of players.
